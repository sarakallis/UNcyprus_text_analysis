# Automated Text Analysis of Tweets (UN Cyprus and UNDP Cyprus)

During the first semester of my MA, I was writing a term paper on environmental peacebuilding in Cyprus, and the role of different UN agencies in this process. As part of an exploratory analysis, I conducted a brief automated text analysis on the then-latest 3000 tweets of the two major UN agencies, 'UN_Cyprus' (encompassing the Peacekeeping Operation UNFICYP and UN Good Offices), and UNDP Cyprus. I scraped the tweets myself in R, but am not including the source code as the API key I used is not for public use.

This analysis includes code for cleaning up the corpus, creating a document term matrix, and visualising term frequencies in word clouds and bar charts. There is also a brief sentiment analysis of each corpus.
